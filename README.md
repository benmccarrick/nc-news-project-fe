# Northcoders News Web Application 

The intention of this project was to build the front-end of Northcoders News - a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website. Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics, and each article has user-curated ratings from upvotes and downvotes using the API. Users can also add comments about an article.
